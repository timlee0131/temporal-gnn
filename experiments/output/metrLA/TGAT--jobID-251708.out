torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 23.54 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 79.15 GiB of which 6.98 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 72.17 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 70.76 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 43.11 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
